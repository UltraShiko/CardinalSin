    "I open my eyes at the sunset beaming through the window. Looks like I was more tired
    than I thought..."
    "That damned banshee nearly killed us. To be given so much trouble by a lowly succubus, it's humiliating."
    "Her kind isn't supposed to be that deadly, at least one-on-one. And now she's out doing Ishmael-knows-what."
    "I sit up, my stomach grumbling."
    extend " It's been three days since I last ate. I should have a syringe lying around somewhere."

    play sound door_open
    "The door creaks open and I my eyes narrow at the lanky elf emerging."
    "Disgust graces my tongue. I'd sooner starve than feed on him, even if he was the last mortal on the plane..."

    ni "Wow, you were out like a light. Never thought you'd struggle against a succubus."
    gr "Be quiet, Nick."
    ni "Hehe...of course she was the banshee who caused {i}the Reckoning{/i}."
    extend " Too bad you can't wield silver."
    gr "Hmph, I only need to tear him limb from limb. I'll let the monk finish her off."

    "I put on my boots, stand, and stretch. I wish my scenery wasn't so unpleasant."
    "This elf is revolting!" 
    extend " His hair is disheveled, his jagged fingernails are unsightly, and he's wearing short sleeves 
    despite it snowing outside,"
    "Worst of all, he's a Malconvoker - a buffoon who summons devils to fight other devils. It's only a matter of time 
    before one takes his head off."
    "Granted, I'm no saint myself. We only avoid execution because we Emissaries hunt down the trash the Celestials don't 
    wish to deal with."
    extend "It is no less than what I deserve for my weakness."

    gr "Speaking of, how is Caius?"
    ni "He'll be fine. Though he will need to get used to wearing a mask. His mana was gushing like a fountain."
    gr "What the hell happened? I patched up his wounds. He was fine for a moment, then white mana starts spilling out."
    ni "That's Justice for you."
    gr "Justice?"
    ni "Ahh, it's the mana of angels. Much like how your Malice is from Hell."
    extend " Mortals weren't intended to wield it. And when they do, it tears their body apart."
    gr "Doesn't Malice do the same?"
    ni "Malice wears on your soul when overused. Justice is like turning your very soul into a weapon. It will kill you, and
    probably everyone else nearby if mishandled."
    ni "On top of that, your friend is a lunatic."
    gr "He's not insane, you are."
    ni "Not every lunatic is insane.. He just sees the world differently than us."
    gr "hmmm..."

    "I scratch my chin. It does make sense."
    extend " Caius rarely made eye contact without straining himself. One of his limbs, and sometimes his entire body, 
    was always in motion."
    "It was humorous watching him weave past Persephone's attacks. I thought it was how he fought. How peculiar..."

    gr "And you gauged that from treating an unconscious body."
    ni "Well it's also how his mana flows. It doesn't have the restraints that a normal person does, so 
    it's no wonder Justice started erupting out of nowhere."
    extend " I hypothesize the stress of that battle must've led to him somehow channeling it. It comes from our
    regrets. "

    "I see. Jory told me the monk lost control when he learned what happened to his hometown. Most notably, some old companion
    of his."
    "Consider the regrets I have, I wonder why that white mana didn't sprout from me. Guess I'm not pure enough."

    gr "Hmph, than I'll let him rest. I have a banshee to hunt."
    ni "I'd prefer you not-"

    play sound grapple
    "I yank the fool by his collar, only for him to smile whimiscally."
    "If he wasn't useful, I'd crush his neck where we stood. But he'd enjoy every second of it. This maniac adores pain."
    extend " Granted, I adore hitting him..."

    gr "Listen you cur! If that banshee causes another Reckoning, we're finished! Our Empire is on the verge of war as is!"
    ni "Ehehehe..."
    gr "So, I'm going to track her down and finish what we started. Are we clear?"
    ni "But Griswyr, I found a nest of Paste smugglers..."
    gr "Really?"

    "I release him. He crumples, and recovers to his feet haphazardly. He isn't even winded after being manhandled."
    "He hands me a writ. It's a search warrant written by the Celestials to search some house, under 
    suspicion of the occupant harboring Sanguine Paste."
    "My fingers tense upon reading those wretched words. That infernal drug causes nothing but problems, and people 
    {i}still{/i} use it?!"
    extend " I'd know, I was one of those idiots..."

    ni "Consider this your reward for dealing with those cultists."
    gr "Hmm... Why are you giving me this? Surely, you understand that Persephone is our top priority."
    ni "She is, and I intend to help you find her, but there's something I want to examine first."
    extend " You know how a dretchling destroyed Thrycia?"
    gr "How can I not? It's what put Caius into a coma. And it wasn't a dretchling."
    ni "Absolutely not. So I just want to do a bit of research and-"
    gr "It's that pain devil, isn't it?!" with vpunch

    "He grins sheepishly. Maybe I should kill him after all!"
    "When I first met this loon, he had a brute of a fiend bound to his surface. She was over seven feet tall and 
    a monster by devil standards."
    "I told this loon {b}countless{/b} times to slit her throat and be done with it."
    extend " Well, he didn't listen, she broke free, and is going to be a {b}pain in the ass{/b] to take down."

    ni "I doubt Persephone was behind this, though maybe more of Hecate's cultists were..."
    gr "For your sake, you better hope it's those Thorns! I'm certain you realize the carnage a pain devil would cause."
    ni "Hehehe...oh it'd be a bloodbath. There's a reason I  bound her."
    gr "Yes, spite, because you blame her for your failure. As if you alone could've stopped {i}the Reckoning{/i}."
    ni "Hard to close a tear in the plane with a chain through your chest."
    extend " It was so wonderful!"
    gr "You're disgusting!"

    "Hmm, prioritize drug dealers or the very monster that nearly destroyed everything. The choice is obvious."
    extend " However, I have no leads. And Thrycia, or what remains of it, is a week's journey. If that pain devil is there,
    it'd be curtains for me."
    "As much as I'm loath to admit it, these paste dealers are a better target. And I detest them with a burning passion."
    "When overused, Sanguine Paste warps your humanity. It makes you crave forbidden pleasures, that ultimately turn to the blood
    of others."
    extend " These drug dealers may as well be plaguespreaders. They won't threaten humanity, but removing their infection is
    still a service."

    gr "Fine, I'll snuff out this operation. Be grateful I hate Sanguine Paste more than you."
    ni "It does keep you in line hehehe-"

    "I send him spiraling into the desk on my way out."
    extend " Attacking him is fruitless, but it makes me better. It's too addicting..."
