    "I return and find both Caius and Nick conversing."
    "The pious boy, now masked, looks to me in horror and rushes over. Nick is as unfazed as alway."

    c "A-Are you alright?!"
    gr "Take your hand off me. These wounds aren't fatal."
    n "Oof, what happened? Vampire?"
    gr "I don't know what the hell he was, but he's dead. Now get my casket!"

    "Caius revulses as a wooden mug, filled to the brim with blood's metallic stench, isp lace before me."
    extend " I down it, without breathing. My pained body now tingles rather than throb. I feel as if
    I'm drunk, with both fatigue and drowsiness setting in."

    gr "With a day of rest, I'll be as right as rain. My body isn't feeble unlike yours, monk."
    ca "I'm, I'm not a monk..."
    gr "You look and fight like one."
    ca "And you look like you're in a foul mood."
    gr "You have {i}your friend{/i} to thank for that!"
    ca "Oh, Jory must still be upset..."
    gr "No, and I wish he was."
    
    "That elf has a stupid grin on his face. I glare at him and it only gets bigger."
    "I then take notice of the mask shrouding Caius's forehead. It's not light, it appears glued to his skin."
    extend " Didn't Nick mention this earlier?"

    gr "What's with the headwear?"
    ca "It's to restrain my mana..."
    gr "Nicck?"
    ni "Well, it keeps it from erupting at least. Otherwise it'd burst like a geyser if something upset him."
    extend " He'll be able to fight and channel mana. This will just keep him from exploding."
    ca "And it's stuck to my face..."
    gr "Yeah, why is that?"
    ni "So that it attunes to his mana. Can't have Justice dislodging it."
    extend " He now has a trump card. The inhibitors will vanish if he rips it off. You might want to flee the 
    scene when that happen~."
    gr "Do you mean to tell me this boy I met a day earlier is now a ticking, time bomb."
    ni "Something like that."
    ca "I'm twenty, Griswyr."
    gr "And {i}very{/i} sheltered."

    "Suddenly, a batlike monster, the size of my palm, flies inside. Caius leaps into action
    and I bar his advance."

    ca "Th-That's an imp! We have to-"
    gr "Calm yourself. This is Nick's familiar."
    ca "Wh-what?! But we just fought a devil! Why does he-"
    gr "Stop shouting. Nick summons devils to fight devils. How you didn't learn this sooner
    disappoints me."
    bu "Good evening! Buzz brings reconnaissance~."

    "The way this ugly, devil-coated cockroach gives me a migraine. Oh Ishmael, how much further will
    you test my patience tonight?!"
    "Nick chuckles faintly. He isn't amused, he's guilty."

    gr "Caius, fetch me a broom."
    extend " On second thought, a broom won't do. Grab me that staff over there."
    ca "Umm, okay...?"
    ni "Alright Buzz, tell them what we saw."
    bu "Oooh yes, city destroyed! Burned! Blood and ash everywhere! Many dead knights, with red
    and brown armors scattered about! It was hilarious! Favorite mission so far~!"
    gr "Hmm, so those hellknights perpetuated that..."
    ni "Yep... They lacked the numbers to face the Celestials, so they sacked Thrycia. I guess they
    believed this wouldn't warrant retaliation since it was independent."
    gr "I do not understand why we cling to this peace. It's only a matter of time before those
    peons attack again."
    b "Unlikely! All of them are dead hahahaha!"
    ca "W-wait, you were at Thrycia?!"

    "Caius eagerly passes me the stave. His eyes are filled with despearation, hoping that his friend
    was not responsible, I imagine."
    "The imp eyes him like a slab of meat. I guess devils big and small can't resist corrupting souls
    as virtuous as his."

    gr "Nick, keep your pet under control or you'll need a new one."
    bu "Aiieee... Buzz continue."
    ca "Did you see a dretchling? Any survivors?"
    bu "Nope~. Buzz said everyone dead. However...Buzz found a charred silhouette into the ground~. Only
    devils could broil the earth like that. We explode when slain."
    gr "Oh really? Tell us more..!"

    play sound Lightgrapple
    "The wood creaks in my palms and Nick gulps in excitement."
    "I arch forward, already knowing what that imp is going to say. I only await for vindication."

    bu "Buzz know mana signature of the deceased. Yes yes, the hellknights were not alone. In fact, some corpses
    were nice and crispy~. Electrocuted, hmhmhm!"
    bu "Buzz detect powerful mana. Very malicious and sadistic. We devils enjoy torturing others, but this one's
    bloodlust is unrivaled."

    extend " Buzz darts to the ceiling and Caius watches, horrified, as I proceed to kick the elf over and over."
    "Small giggles emit with each boot that bludgeons his chest. I'm almost happy he's enjoying it, because I don't
    need to worry about breaking him."

    gr "Behold, monk!"

    "I yank Nick up by his hair and make him face Caius."
    "Ishmael knows what godforsaken expression is on Nick's face. I never understood Caius's fixation
    on joining us."
    extend " Either way, here's his chance to quit!"

    gr "Thrycia was your home, right? And remember how your companion was blamed for its destruction?"
    extend " Well, can thank this maniac for that!. Yes, the leader of us Emissaries is an irresponsible lunatic who
    summons devils! He is who you'll be working for."
    ca "...If you understood how destructive this monster could be, why would you bind her?"
    ni "Her and I have history... "
    gr "Worst of all, she's going to want revenge, and you and I will be the ones to hunt
    her down! If you thought Persephone was bad, oh Ishmael... You are not prepared!"
    ni "Devils take years to revive. We have tim-"

    gr "Be quiet, swine!" with vpunch
    gr "So if this tomfoolery has taught you anything monk, it's to leave. Go join the Celestials
    if you want to play the hero."
    c "Hmm..."

    "He squints at us both." 
    extend " As dumbfounded as he was, I'm impressed with how quickly he regained his composure. Especially 
    considering how he just lost his hometown because of an idiot."
    "Granted, Caius has a level head despite him being green. He only loses himself when his past is
    brought up, a weakness the banshee exploited..."
    
    ca "...You summon fiends, does that mean you know how to defeat them?"
    ni "Of course. It's my passion. A really bad passion hehehe, but I know just about everything when it comes
    to devils."
    gr "He's only escaped the noose because he's useful. Even the Third had to put up with him."
    ca "Tell me Nick, can you track down my friend. If you can bind devils, perhaps you can seek out a
    dretchling?"
    gr "You don't need this fool's aid to do this. Consult the Reverend."
    ca "I'm aware, but fiends are drawn to dretchlings like moths to a flame. Maybe this pain devil was after
    him. Or maybe something else was."
    b "Buzz knows~! Two mana signatures were detected."
    gr "...And you wait to tell us this because?"
    b "Second signature was weak. No corpse detected. It was a fiend, a very powerful fiend~!"

    "I groan as Caius's eyes expand. He has a one track mind, this monk..."
    "He'll be a liability at this rate. All some monster has to do is capture his friend and Caius iwll
    fold."
    extend " Besides, we Emissaries are not saviors."

    gr "Monk, heed my words."
    extend " If you think I'm about to partake on some rescue mission, do us both a service and abandon 
    {i}all{/i} hopes of joining us."
    ca "...I know it's very pious of me. However, Nick has no trace on where Persephone went. I wonder if
    she might be involved somehow?"
    gr "Do you honestly believe some dretchling would attract the banshee?"
    ca "The fiendish presence was powerful, and we both know how powerful she is."
    extend " Frankly, I plan on going to Thrycia with or without you. It was what I wanted to do
    before, you know..."
    gr "Thrycia is a week away on horseback. Do you plan to walk?"
    n "I can arrange a carriage"
    gr "Be quiet-"
    n "Nah. I think Caius has a point."
    extend " More importantly, there's another powerful fiend on the loose. We probably need to stop it."
    gr "Do not fill his head with fantasies, Malconvoker. He barks up the wrong tree."
    n "I don't think so. Otherwise, he would've fled to the reverend once he learned it was my fault."
    extend " You're misreading, Griswyr. He wants to save his friend, but he also wants to fight devils."
    ca "That, and I believe that the Celestials aren't addressing the root of our problems. I'd much rather cleanse
    the source, even if I have to get my hands dirty..."
    n "And besides vampire, someone needs to keep you in-"

    "I toss him into the wall. I've heard enough of his dribble."

    gr "Very well, you are hereby my suboordinate."
    extend " But understand this. We will do things {i}my{/i} way. I'm not interested in rescuing damsels, or your
    friend."
    extend " In fact, I plan to kill him if he's aiding fiends, and I expect you to back me up."
    c "I'm aware..."
    gr "Elf, make arrangements. Once my wounds are healed, we depart."
    extend " As for you, monk."
    ca "Why do you keep calling me that...?"
    gr "Start trying to get that mana of yours under control. If you're truly able to wield Justice, we'll need that
    firepower."
    extend " More importantly, I don't want to have to protect you from yourself. I expect you to make the 
    most of your respite."
    ca "You don't have to tell me twice."
    bu "Buzz accompany you~. Act as eyes and ears for master."
    ni "Yes, try not lose your temper on him, Griswyr."
    gr "I make no promises..."

    "I rest on one of the cots, throwing the blanket over my face so I don't have to see either of those loons."
    "My mind races, still in disbelief that I channeled Sin in place of Malice. Does this imply I'm getting
    soft? I sure hope not..."
    "I clench my fists, still irate at what Jory said."
    extend " That \"kindness\" nearly cost me my life. Am I to be food for monsters because I'm sentimental now? I'd
    sooner die!"

    vi "Hey Snowflake! We need to chat."

    "A voice booms into my ear. No one else is here, Caius and Nick would've reacted by now, so it must be
    telepathy."
    extend " That, and only one person addresses me like that. And our base is littered with alarm wards."

    gri "Banshee. To what do I owe the displeasure?"
    pei "So I did some digging, and you're a liar. You weren't jinxed, you fed on a child... You turned 
    him into a freak, {b}after{/b}, you killed his mother in front of him!"
    gri "Heh, do my ears betray me, or does {i}the banshee{/i} have a bleeding heart?"
    gri "The fact that you fell for such a fib betrays your ignorance. Perhaps you aren't
    as clever as I thought."
    pei "Yeah well here's something to chew on. If I see you again, it's on sight!"
    extend " And here I was pitying you, willing to take you under my wing. You're disgusting, 
    and that's coming from me..."
    gri "Oh no, the Banshee doesn't approve of me. I'm certain to lose so much sleep."
    extend " If you're so offended, then stop hiding. We'll find you eventually."
    pei "In due time, Snowflake. Your days are numbered all the same. You'll beg for death when Mother gets her
    hands on you."

    "She stops responding. I opt not to inform my comrades. We can't trace telepathy by itself."
    "I reach for my hatchet and view my bloodied reflection."
    extend " I gather some of it in my finger and lick it, treating myself to a monstrous visage."

    gr "Wonderful! That's just the way I like it, banshee!"
