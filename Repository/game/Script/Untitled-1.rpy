    "I open my eyes at the sunset beaming through the window. Looks like I was more tired
    than I thought..."
    "That damned banshee nearly killed us. To be given so much trouble by a lowly succubus, it's humiliating."
    "Her kind isn't supposed to be that deadly, at least one-on-one. And now she's out doing Ishmael-knows-what."
    "I sit up, my stomach grumbling."
    extend " It's been three days since I last ate. I should have a syringe lying around somewhere."

    "The door creaks open and I my eyes narrow at the lanky elf emerging."

    v "Wow, you were out like a light. Never thought you'd struggle against a succubus."
    gr "Be quiet, Nick."
    ni "Hehe...of course she was the banshee who caused {i}the Reckoning{/i}."
    gr "And she won't be free for long."

    "I put on my boots, stand, and stretch. I wish my scenery wasn't so unpleasant."
    "This elf is disgusting. His hair is disheveled, his jagged fingernails are unsightly, and he's wearing short sleeves despite it snowing outside,"
    "Worst of all, he's a Malconvoker. A buffoon who summons devils to fight other devils. It's only a matter of time before one takes his head off."
    "Granted, I'm no saint myself. We only avoid execution because we Emissaries hunt down the trash the Celestials don't wish to deal with."
    "It is no less than what I deserve for my weakness."

    gr "How is Caius."
    ni "He'll be fine. Though he will need to get used to wearing a mask. His mana was gushing like a fountain."
    gr "What the hell happened? I patched up his wounds. He was fine for a moment, then white mana starts spilling out."
    ni "That's Justice for you."
    gr "Justice?"
    ni "Ahh, it's the mana of angels. Much like how your Malice is from Hell."
    extend " Mortals weren't intended to wield it. And when they do, it tears their body apart."
    ni "On top of that, I believe your friend is a lunatic."
    gr "He's not insane, you are."
    ni "Not every lunatic resorts to madness. He just sees the world differently than us."
    gr "And you gauged that from treating an unconscious body."
    ni "Well it's also how his mana flows. It doesn't have the restraints that a normal person does, so it can surge sporadically."
    extend " I hypothesize the stress of that battle must've led to him somehow channeling Justice."
    gr "Hmph, than I'll let him rest. I have a banshee to hunt."
    ni "I'd prefer you not-"

    "I yank the fool by his neck, only for him to smile whimiscally."
    "If he wasn't useful, I'd crush his neck where we stood. But he'd enjoy every second of it. This maniac adores pain."
    extend " Granted, I adore hitting him."

    gr "Listen you cur! If that banshee causes another Reckoning, we're finished! Our Empire is on the verge of war as is!"
    ni "Ehehehe..."
    gr "So, I'm going to track her down and finish what we started. Are we clear?"
    ni "But Griswyr, I found a nest of Paste smugglers..."
    gr "Really?"

    "I release him. He crumples, and recovers to his feet haphazardly. He isn't even winded after being strangled."
    "He hands me a writ. It's a search warrant written by the Celestials to search the premises, under suspicion of the occupant harboring Sanguine Paste."
    "My fingers tense upon reading those dreaded words. That infernal drug causes nothing but problems, and people still seek out its indulgence."
    extend " I'd know, I was one of those idiots..."

    ni "Consider this your reward for dealing with those cultists."
    gr "Hmm... Why are you giving me this? Surely, you understand that Persephone is our top priority."
    ni "She is, and I intend to help you find her, but there's something I want to examine first."
    extend " You know how a dretchling destroyed Thrycia?"
    gr "How can I not? It's what put Caius into a coma. And it wasn't a dretchling."
    ni "Absolutely not. So I just want to do a bit of research and-"
    gr "It's that pain devil, isn't it?!" with vpunch

    "He grins sheepishly. Maybe I should kill him after all!"
    "When I first met this loon, he had a brute of a fiend bound to his surface. She was over seven feet tall and a monster by fiendish standards."
    "I told this buffoon {b}countless{/b} times to slit her throat and be done with it."
    extend " Well, he didn't listen, she broke free, and is going to be a {b}pain in the ass{/b] to take down."

    ni "I doubt Persephone was behind this, though maybe more of Hecate's cultists were..."
    gr "For your sake, you better hope it's those Thorns! I'm certain you realize the carnage a Pain devil would cause."
    ni "Hehehe...oh it'd be a bloodbath. There's a reason I had bound her."
    gr "Yes, spite, because you blame her for your failure. As if you alone could've stopped the Reckoning."
    ni "Hard to close a tear in the plane with a chain through your chest."
    extend " It was so wonderful!"
    gr "You're disgusting!"
    gr "Fine, I'll snuff out this operation. Be grateful I hate Sanguine Paste more than you!"
    ni "It does keep you in line hehehe-"
    
    "I send spiraling into the desk on my way out. Attacking him is fruitless, but it makes me better at least."
