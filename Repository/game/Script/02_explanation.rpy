    "I open my eyes at the sunset streaming through the window.\nLooks like I was more tired than I thought..."
    "That damned banshee nearly killed us.\nTo be given so much trouble by a lowly succubus, it's humiliating."
    "Her kind isn't usually that deadly, at least one-on-one.\nAnd now she's out doing Ishmael-knows-what."
    "I sit up, my stomach grumbling."
    extend "\nIt's been three days since I last ate. I should have a syringe lying around somewhere."

    "The door creaks open, and I narrow my eyes at the lanky elf that enters."
    "Disgust graces my tongue.\nI'd sooner starve than feed on him, even if he was the last mortal on the plane."

    ni "Wow, you were out like a light.\nNever thought you'd struggle against a succubus."
    
    gr "Be quiet, Nick."

    gr "Hmph, I only need to tear him limb from limb. The monk can do the rest.."

    "I put on my boots, stand, and stretch.\nI wish my scenery wasn't so unpleasant."
    "This elf is revolting!" 
    extend " His hair is disheveled, his jagged fingernails are unsightly, and he's wearing short sleeves despite the winter's snow."
    "Worst of all, he's a Malconvoker - a buffoon who summons devils to fight other devils. It's only a matter of time before one takes his head off."
    "Granted, I'm no saint myself.\nWe only avoid execution because we Emissaries hunt down the trash the Celestials don't wish to deal with."
    "It is no less than what I deserve for my weakness."

    gr "Speaking of, how is Caius?"
    
    ni "He'll be fine. Though he will need to get used to wearing a mask.\nHis mana was gushing like a fountain."
    
    gr "What the hell happened? I patched up his wounds.\nHe was fine for a moment, then this white mana started spilling out."
    
    ni "That's Justice for you."
    
    gr "Justice?"
    
    ni "Ahh, it's the mana of angels. Much like how your Malice is from Hell."
    extend " Mortals weren't intended to wield it. And when they do, it tears their body apart."
    
    gr "Doesn't Malice do the same?"
    
    ni "Malice wears on your soul when overused.\nJustice is like turning your very soul into a weapon. It will kill you, and probably everyone else nearby if mishandled."
    ni "On top of that, your friend is a lunatic."
    
    gr "He's not insane, you are."
    
    ni "Not every lunatic is insane. He just sees the world differently than us."
    
    gr "Hmmm..."

    "I scratch my chin. It does make sense."
    "For example, Caius rarely makes eye contact without straining himself. And one of his limbs, and sometimes his entire body, is always in motion."
    "It was humorous watching him weave past Persephone's attacks. I figured he had an unusual fighting style."
    "Has he weaponized his peculiarity? Hmm..."

    gr "And you gauged that much just from treating an unconscious body?"
    
    ni "Well, how his mana flows was also a clue.\nIt doesn't have the restraints that a normal person does, so it's no wonder Justice started erupting from him out of nowhere."
    ni "I hypothesize the stress of that battle must've led to him somehow channeling it. Justice manifests from one's regrets, much like your Malice comes from hatred. "

    "I see. Jory told me the monk lost control when he learned what happened to his hometown. Most notably, the fate of some old companion of his."
    "Considering the regrets I have, I wonder why that white mana hasn't sprouted from me yet. Guess I'm not pure enough."

    gr "Hmph, than I'll let him rest. I have a banshee to hunt."
    
    ni "I'd prefer you not-"

    "I yank the fool by his collar, only for him to smile whimiscally."
    "If he wasn't so useful, I'd crush his neck where we stand.\nBut he'd enjoy every second of it anyway. This maniac adores pain."    
    extend " Granted, I adore hitting him..."

    gr "Listen, you disgusting cur! If that banshee causes another Reckoning, we're finished! Our Empire is on the verge of war as it is!"
    
    ni "Ehehehe..."

    gr "So, I'm going to track her down and finish what we started.\nAre we clear?"
    
    ni "But Griswyr, I found a nest of Paste smugglers..."
    
    gr "Really?"

    "I release him. He crumples, then regains his footing haphazardly.\nHe isn't even winded after being manhandled."
    "He hands me a writ. It's a warrant written by the Celestials to search some house, under suspicion of the occupant harboring Sanguine Paste."
    "My fingers tense upon reading those wretched words.\nThat infernal drug causes nothing but problems, and people {i}still{/i} use it!"
    extend "\nI'd know, I was one of those idiots..."

    ni "Consider this your reward for dealing with those cultists."
    
    gr "Hmm... Why are you giving me this?\nSurely, you understand that Persephone is our top priority."
    
    ni "She is, and I intend to help you find her, but there's something I want to investigate first."
    extend " You know how a dretchling destroyed Thrycia?"
    
    gr "How can I not? It's what put Caius into a coma.\nAnd it wasn't a dretchling."
    
    ni "Absolutely not. So I just want to do a bit of research and-"
    
    gr "It's that pain devil, isn't it?!" with vpunch

    "He grins sheepishly. Maybe I should kill him after all!"
    "When I first met this loon, he had a brute of a fiend bound to his service. She was over seven feet tall and a even monster by devil standards."
    "I told this fool {b}countless{/b} times to slit her throat and be done with it."
    extend "\nWell, he didn't listen, she broke free, and is going to be a {b}pain in the ass{/b} to take down."

    ni "I doubt Persephone was behind this, though maybe more of Hecate's cultists were..."
    
    gr "For your sake, you better hope it's those Thorns!\nI'm certain you realize the carnage a pain devil would cause."
    
    ni "Hehehe... Oh it'd be a bloodbath. There's a reason I bound her."
    
    gr "Yes, spite, because you blame her for your failure.\nAs if you alone could've stopped {i}the Reckoning{/i}."
    
    ni "Hard to close a tear in the plane with a chain through your chest."
    extend "\nIt was so wonderful!"
    
    gr "You're revolting!" with vpunch

    "Hmm, prioritize drug dealers or the very monster that nearly destroyed everything. The choice is obvious."
    "However, I have no leads. And Thrycia, or what remains of it, is a week's journey away. Even if I do find the pain devil there, it'd be curtains for me."
    "As much as I'm loath to admit it, these paste dealers are the safer target right now. And I detest them with a burning passion."
    "When overused, Sanguine Paste warps your humanity.\nIt makes you crave forbidden pleasures until you ultimately turn to seeking the blood of others."
    "These drug dealers may as well be plaguespreaders.\nThey won't threaten all of humanity, but removing their infection is still a service."

    gr "Fine, I'll snuff out this operation.\nBe grateful I hate Sanguine Paste more than I hate you."
    
    ni "It does keep you in line, hehehe-"
