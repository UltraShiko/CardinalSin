    "I skulk away, my foootfalls making no sound. My stomach growls, and my eyes dilate. Good!"
    extend " Monstrosity follows my gnawing hunger. These heightened senses make tracking all to easy."
    "I see many prints in the snow, but one pattern stands outs."
    extend " These tracks are haphazard, almost as if he was hopping about like a rabbit. Intoxication leads to vivid hallucinations. I remember thinking I could fly during one of them..."
    "I take a whiff. The sickly sweet smell irritates my nose. Sanguine Paste smells eerily similar to candy."
    extend " So these tracks belong to an addict, or a loon. Either way, I follow them."
    "The stench of the paste grows stronger with each step. Is he indulging even as I track himm? I'm prepared all the same, this'll just make subdoing him easier."
    "I snarl. I no longer crave that wretched paste but I don't want to reek of it either! This disgusting oaf is going to regret using."
    "Soon the prints are followed by sounds. Their keeper is babbling not too far from here."

    v "Hey-hey! Yes Charlotta, it's me! I'm back just as I promised!"
    v "Ohohoho! There's no way you could be evil. Not with those sweet, voluptuous tits of yours! If they drag me to Hell, I won't struggle~! Unless you want me too..."
    v "Ohh my sweet! I'm not going to wait. Let us make love this time! Who cares if it's in the snow?! And if anyone sees us, let 'em watch!"

    "Despicable swine! I can't believe the levels I must sink too..."
    extend " Hmmm... A hatchet to the head would shut him up. I could just find someone else, but..."
    extend " No, he'll do. I'll drink his blood as payment. He {i}clearly{/i} doesn't need it anymore."
    "He comes in my sights, arms and body flailing for an illusion. Hiding is hardly necessary."
    "Regardless I crouch. I calculate the distance between us."
    extend " No weapons or mana will be needed. I don't know why I bother preparing to attack.." 
    extend " My instincts call for wariness, even from an oaf trapped in stupor."
    "I breathe in, my fangs now visible. I won't need my instincts after I'm through with him."
    extend " He'll squeal like a pig, and then I {b}FEAST!{/b}" with vpunch 

    m "Ohhh Charlotta, take me... Take-"

    play sound Crash
    extend " Gahhh!!!" with vpunch

    "I pin him in seconds, his chest facing me."
    extend " I snatch a vial from my bandolier and pop the cork. He grins foolishly."

    m "Oh...my dear Charlotta. I didn't know you liked it so-"
    #play sound potion
    extend " Ngh, ahh...{b}AaaaaAAAGHHHH!!!{/b}"

    "I ram the elixir's contents up his nose. It's much quicker than forcing it down his throat."
    extend " To call this an elixir is generous. It's mere garlic concentrated into a liquid."
    "It's amusing how many think garlic repels me. Granted, it's very effective for ending the effects of the paste."
    "His eyes twitch and snot runs down both nostrils. I then retrieve the vial and clean it in the snow."
    extend " Tears leave both eyes, but they're no longer glazed. His gaze becomes fearful now as it meets mine."

    m "Agh...by Ishmael, what the-?"
    
    gr "Sobered up, are we?"
    
    m "Nnngh, those eyes. Are you a dretchling..?!"
    
    gr "You dare compare me to them? Your foolishness is beginning to offend me."
    
    m "No wait, you have fangs... And your eyes, they're...so-"
    extend " By Ishmael! Vampire!!!" with vpunch 

    "I chuckle. His squirms only entertain me. He can writhe and scream as he much as he likes, no one is saving him."
    "I imagine he wishes Charlotta was here in my place. Perhaps Hell will have a devil in store for him to tend to his wishes."
    extend " Unfortunately, he'll likely fall to the circle of gluttony. Succubi can be found there, but I wager they're {i}far{/i} less gentle."

    gr "You have two options, pig. You can tell me what I want to know and have a painless death."
    extend " Or, I can break each bone in your body and watch you suffer if you hold out on me. The choice is yours."

    gr "First off, where did you find that paste?"
    
    m "What-what does a monster like you want with-"
    
    play sound grapple
    
    extend " Gngh! I-Ican't tell you! He'll, he'll kill-"
    
    play sound bone_snap
    
    extend " {b}GAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!{/b}" with vpunch
    
    gr "One down, nine to go."

    "His pinky snaps like a twig and I grip the other one. Though, I'm being much too merciful counting down
    and giving him time to reconsider."
    extend " After all, there are 205 more bones left to break. Outliers happen of course, but I imagine he won't be 
    conscious long enough for it to matter."

    gr "Talk, you wretch."
    
    play sound light_grapple
    
    m "Ngh... I, I-"
    v "Goddamned leech!" with vpunch 

    "Booted footsteps trample our way. It's those hallowmen again, how quaint..."
    "The band approach but don't draw too close. One is bold enough to have his sword out."
    extend " I tense up. Like devils, I'm susceptible to silver. Assuming he can hit me, that is."
    
    play sound bone_snap
    
    "I meet their gaze, then break the other pinky."
    extend " His outcry provokes the band to march closer. I grab his index finger, ready to resume
    as if they weren't present."

    gr "We aren't done here. Where did you find that paste?"
    
    c "Release him at once! We are taking custody of this man!"
    
    gr "Under what authority? I outrank you both."
    
    m "That's...impossible! There's no way in Hell you're a-"
    extend " Wait, if you  outrank them that means... That means..."
    
    gr "Go on, remind them of their place~."
    
    c "We don't give a {b}damn{/b} about your station, Emissary! You're all a bunch of crooks who escaped the noose! And what you're doing now proves it!"
    
    gr "Hmm, so if I choose to break another finger..."
    
    c "By Ishmael, he isn't your target! I thought you were after the dealer!"
    
    gr "I need information, and he's keeping it from me. He fears his supplier more than me..!"
    extend " But if you wish to oppose me, you're free to try."

    "After all, there are no other witnesses in sight. As big as Jubilee is, many murders still go unnoticed down here."
    "I shiver from excitement."
    extend " Four men. Four sacks of blood... Had I taken the syringe, I would've missed out on this banquet!" with vpunch
    "It'd only take five seconds, and I'll have these merry men on the ground and painted carmine. They can cry out, I'll be done long before help arrives."
    "Perhaps after I butcher these pretenders, my quarry will speak up. It isn't like the reverend is coming to save him, though I'd be delighted if he tried!"
    "I flash my fangs at the intruders. They recoil and ready their weapons."

    c "Ishmael shield us, he's eyeing us like meat!"

    "I stand, dragging my morsel to his feet. They can see my hatchet from this angle, but not my sword."
    "I lurch forward. In one fell swoop, this'll be over."
    extend " My heart races. They'll all be dead in three..."
    extend " Two..."
    
    m "Okay! It's Christoph! {b}CHRISTOPHHH!!!{/b}" with vpunch

    gr "Gngh!"

    "My body recoils at his name. Why...?"
    extend " I'm no longer eager nor entertained. And we vampires aren't susceptible to magic, which means Christoph wasn't an incantation. So what gives the word power over me?"
    "If anything, it sparks clarity in my mind. The ferocity I felt slips away as I regain my composure."
    extend " Damnable hunger... Was I {i}truly{/i} about to stoop to murder? Over a quick bite nontheless. How pathetic!"
    "I shove him into their arms and take the syringe from my belt."
    extend " As the blood pumps into my arm, sanity returns. My eyesight dulls as do my other senses, but having them enhanced is no use to me if it drives me to madness."
    "The heroes look at me in disbelief. This must quite the night for them."

    c "You're...releasing him? Ishmael must live indeed."

    gr "Talk, morsel, before I change my mind."
    
    m "He's...he's a goblin butcher. He reeks of blood and gore, but he always has the paste."
    
    gr "Ngh!"
    
    m "Look...for a house with a deer's skull on the front door. That's where we'd have our parties. They were so...amazing."
    
    gr "Does he worship any archfiends? Dharts, specifically?"
    
    m "No, but he gives us the same look you gave me earlier..."
    extend " Now that I think about it, a lot of us addicts disappear as we indulge. I figured they used too much and succumbed to illness."
    m "Christoph doesn't care. \"Tis the price they pay for pleasure\", as he would say..."

    c "How vile..."

    "Every time that infernal name is mentioned, I twitch."
    extend " I oughta cut this butcher down for that slight alone. For some reason, I feel nostalgia when I hear his name. But I never met a butcher by it..."
    "But have I ever met a goblin? They're uncommon in the cities."
    extend " They're not trusted. They're treated better than the dretchlings, but that's hardly impressive. So they stick to the forests."
    "Many look at them as savages. Some are, resorting to banditry and ambushing travelers. They can be a real nuisance under the proper leader."
    "However I've never been sent to dispatch them. They're pests for guards and upstart adventurers to deal with. So I couldn't have battled one..."

    m "That's everything I know I swear!"
    
    gr "Hmph, get him out of my sight. His babbling has spoiled my appetite."
    
    c "I'm not so sure... What's sparked this change in you? Hoping to dine on the others instead?"
    
    gr "As I said, my appetite has been spoiled..."
    extend " Besides I'm only delaying his death. When he relapses and this \"Charlotta\" turns him into what I've become, I will slay him."
    
    m "You, you saw all of that?!"

    gr "Regrettably, I did..."
    extend " Considering the intel, I wager this Christoph is a monster just like myself. You all are free to accompany me at your own peril."
    gr "As the addiction turns you, you crave more and more forbidden tastes, ending with blood. He is likely using his supplies to attract more prey."

    "The hallowmen turn to each other, mutter, than turn back to me."
    "The hostility in their faces has evaporated. They look to me with concern and hope."
    extend " Do they now understand the severity of our situation? Or do they misjudge me for sparing that pig?"
    "I grumble. I do hope they aren't foolish enough to believe the latter. I nearly tore their throats open. And it's not too late for a relapse..."

    c "We'll escort this man to the jail, but do you need back up? Or some Holy Water?"

    gr "I cannot wield holy water, and I'll be fine on my own. If anything, I'd prefer it that way."
    
    c "Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot but-"
    
    gr "Save it." 
    extend " You are right for fearing me. And you {i}should{/i} fear me. Do not be swayed, for I may be deceiving you. That is how we monsters entrap our food~."
