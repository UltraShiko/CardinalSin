    extend " I oughta cut this butcher down for that slight alone. For some reason, I feel nostalgia when I hear his name. But I never met a butcher by that name..."

    extend "\nThey're not trusted. They're treated better than the dretchlings, but that's hardly impressive. So they stick to the forests."
    "Many look at them as savages. Some are, resorting to banditry and ambushing travelers. They can be a real nuisance under the proper leader."
    "However, I've never been sent to dispatch them. They're pests for guards and upstart adventurers to deal with. So I couldn't have battled one..."

    m "That's everything I know, I swear!"
    
    gr "Hmph, get him out of my sight. His babbling has spoiled my appetite."

    gr "As I said, my appetite has been spoiled..."
    extend " Besides I'm only delaying his death. When he relapses and this \"Charlotta\" turns him into what I've become, I will slay him."

    gr "Regrettably, I did..."
    extend " Considering the intel, I wager this Christoph is a monster just like myself. You all are free to accompany me at your own peril."
    gr "As the addiction turns you, you crave more and more forbidden tastes, ending with blood. He is likely using his supplies to attract more prey."

    "The hallowmen turn to each other, mutter, than turn back to me."
    "The hostility in their faces has evaporated. They look to me with concern and hope."
    extend " Do they now understand the severity of our situation? Or do they misjudge me for sparing that pig?"
    "I grumble. I do hope they aren't foolish enough to believe the latter.\nI nearly tore their throats open. And it's not too late for a relapse..."

    c "We'll escort this man to the jail, but do you need back up?\nOr some Holy Water?"

    gr "I cannot wield holy water, and I'll be fine on my own.\nIf anything, I'd prefer it that way."
    
    c "Look, I know we got off on the wrong foot but-"
    
    gr "Save it." 
    extend " You are right for fearing me. And you {i}should{/i} fear me."
