    scene jubilee night with dissolve 

    "As I exit, I bury myself under a cloak. Not because I am cold, but to hide my identity."
    "Not as a monster, however. My pale flesh and blood-red eyes can't be concealed. If I'm not mistaken for a dretchling, 
    people see me for what I am."
    extend " A vampire."
    "I only cloak myself to conceal my occupation. We Emissaries are despised at best, and hunted by criminals and fiends 
    otherwise."
    "The Celestials know of us. We even hold some power over them. But any respect they give us is shallow. 
    Many vie for our heads to be on pikes."
    "As I stroll through the snow, people part from my path as if I'm feral. I can't blame them. They're
    {i}almost{/i} right."

    w "Is that a mongrel?"
    m "Worse, a bloody leech. Look at his eyes. He's sizing us up like meat."
    w "Shouldn't the Celestials do something?"
    m "They should, but methinks that leech pulled strings for special treatment. To walk around 
    in public looking like that..."

    "Tch, as if those simpletons would satisfy me. Perhaps if I abandoned my dignity..."
    extend " Their glares and murmurs do not interest me. If I don't hurry, the Smith will close."
    "If those cattle could think, they'd likely figure out what role I serve. Why else would a 
    blood-sucking monster be allowed to roam free?"
    extend " I almost envy their ignorance."

    "Fortunately, I'm just in time. The smith's stand is still open."
    "The grizzled, bloated dwarf eyes me with scorn. As usual, I pull out both my hatchet and sword."
    "We do business only out of necessity. He needs coin, and I cannot afford to purchase a sharpening wheel."
    extend " It would be a gross waste of money for maintaining my arms and armor."

    sm "Back again? All too soon..."
    gr "I want these sharpened."
    sm "Put the money on the table first."

    "I obey. He takes my weapons and hobbles towards the sharpening wheel."

    gr "It would be much faster if I sharpened them myself."
    sm "Ya trying to run me out of business?! I don't want yer mangy mitts on my equipment!"
    gr "Any diseases I'd harbor wouldn't spread through touch."
    sm "But yer foul presence would."
    gr "Suit yourself, dwarf."

    "I lean against his stall, my stomach grumbling."
    extend " I choose to wait on taking the syringe. As my cravings worsen, my senses heighten. 
    Hunger makes you better at finding food after all."
    "This twinge in my gut isn't too unlike when I used to be an addict. Only instead of sweats or mania, 
    I become more feral."
    "Hunting down undesirables has been a wonderful way to stay fed. It's also why I haven't been 
    burnt at the stake."
    extend " To become an Emissary, one must be irredeemably foolish or marked for execution. Most prefer the hangman to our vocation."
    "Why that pious Caius wished to join us over the Celestials still eludes me. As for me, well..."

    sm "I don't suppose ya want yer breastplate repaired as well?"
    gr "Not for this venture. My quarry won't be nearly as threatening."

    "He spits and practically shoves my weapons into my arms."

    sm "Here ya are. Now begone with ya!"
    gr "A satisfactory job as always."
    sm "Hurry along! I don't want no one seeing ya at my stand!"
    gr "Would you prefer drug dealers? That's who I'm going after."
    sm "And not the Celestials? Why is a crook like you getting involved?"
    gr "I suspect it's the same reason why you drink. Consider investing in some incense."

    "I take my posessions and leave."
    extend " Humorously, I hear him start drinking from a bottle on my way out."

    "I review the writ. My quarry is located at some hobble in {i}the Hells{/i}, where the bottomfeeders of Jubilee
    reside." 
    "If the Celestials are doing a search, then maybe I can follow them."
    extend " Before I can finish reading, I notice a band of silvered knights marching by, 
    conveniently right where I need them to be."
    "I follow. I don't hide. What will they do, arrest an Emissary? That would be quite amusing."
    "These white knights are seen as heroes. They take the credit for everything, including our work."
    extend " Granted, the higher-ranked Celestials wield the mana of Grace, and some Justice too. 
    Both manas are highly effeicient at killing devils."
    "Problem is, most of these knights are just showy fodder, celebrated to keep the commoners 
    from panicking. {i}The Reckoning's{/i} scars cut deep."
    "I wonder if that Archfiend Hecate intended to split our empire into halves. Granted, I hear 
    {i}the Third{/i} was a fiend in his own way."
    "They say he was a tyrant. Some say he needed a staff just to wield mana. And he supposedly executed people at
    the drop of a hat."
    extend " Some sympathize with the banshee. What got her burned was an attempt on his life. Hecate's suboordinates
    see her as a martyr despite {i}the Reckoning{/i}."
    "The lackadaisical Nick always grows stern when we speak of {i}The Third{/i}. And this is the
    same buffoon he conjures fiends for a profession."
    
    "As our march continues, a man of over nine feet blocks their path."
    extend " This giant is named Jory. He's a nephillim rumored to have courted the banshee. That's what Caius believes."

    c "Hail Jory!"
    j "It's awfully late for a visit, don't you think?"
    c "We're hear on official business. We believe there are drug dealers nested within the slums. Please step aside."
    j "...You aren't going to cause any trouble, are you?"
    c "Of course not, Jory. Why would the fourth, as gracious as he is, call for us to-"
    j "I wasn't talking to you."

    "He points me out, and the knights turn and wince."
    extend " I smirk as a hallowman grips his sword's pommel."
    "Meanwhile the nephillim scowls at me. Out of everyone who despises me, Jory nets the most respect."
    extend " I had no intention of endagering his pupil. Had I known the banshee was going to 
    be summoned, Nick would've accompanied me instead."

    c "Godforsaken leech! You dare trail us?!"
    gr "Indeed I am. Keep on with your search, it isn't like any of you can stop me."
    c "Monster! I'll drive this this blade through your heart!"
    gr "And kill an Emissary? Heh, that would make my night."
    c "You're no Emissary! You're just-"
    j "Enough!" with vpunch

    "Jory's gentle, yet thunderous voice leaves the knights shivering from more than just the snow."
    "The hallowman look at each other in disbelief, and then turn to Jory, who nods gravely."
    extend " Despite his compoosure, even this gentle giant is bitter with me."
    "He didn't want Caius to join us. I never sought him out of course, but I'm certain Jory blames me for
    what happened."
    extend " The irony is that we battled his lover. Jory doesn't know only because Caius begged me to keep it hidden."
    "It'd be best to tear the bandage from the wound, but it isn't my business interfere with."

    j "Yes, I know him. He's telling the truth."
    c "You must be kidding! The fourth, allow a leech like him to roam free?! Is he mad?"
    gr "As if your low-grade blood could satisfy me."
    c "Then what are you doing here?!"
    gr "Trailing you, as you already observed. I'm after the same criminals you are."
    c "Absolutely not! This doesn't concern you rogues! Half of you are criminals yourselves!"
    gr "You aren't wrong, and you aren't stopping me."
    c "You just want a meal, don't you?!"
    gr "Are you going to shed tears for drug dealers? Do you understand what Sanguine Paste is?"
    extend " I wonder, if you knew that this infernal substance made me what I am today, would 
    you still mourn their deaths?"
    j "Most of them aren't that far gone yet. A lot of them are only sick for now, much like you used to be."
    gr "Perhaps, however I wager their kingpin isn't much different from myself. Drugs like that paste are made by monsters."
    extend " I'm certain you all know that the Archfiend, Dharts, concocted it to spread his kin. They don't call him the 
    {i}King of Hunger{/i} for nothing."
    gr "It's quite impressive how these Archdevils harvest souls. Each one has their own methods, and I intend to stop this 
    plague before it spreads any further."

    "I talk proudly, but I'm well aware I am one of his abominations. If these cattle have anything over me, 
    it's their humanity."
    extend " Hence why it is I who should hunt them down. These sentimental knights will only make things worse. 
    Their sympathy for those who abuse the paste will inevitably help its spread."
    "Besides anyone can indulge in drugs. Even the Reverend. And those who don't indulge in the paste sell it. 
    It's a very lucrative trade, especially after {i}the Reckoning{/i}."
    "I imagine the Celestials will arrest everyone, bring them in, and lock up the addicts for 
    some time. But when they get out, they'll just resume their anttics."
    extend " It's what I did. You can't help those that have become enslaved to the paste. No one could have helped me."

    j "Griswyr, how is Caius?"
    gr "Still asleep, and he will live."
    j "Praise Ishmael..."
    extend " Listen, don't kill anyone you don't have to. Please. My people don't want to see bloodshed."
    gr "I make no promises. A little blood is better than more addicts distirbuting the paste. You might want to see if any of \"your people\"
    are using."
    j "They aren't. I'm well aware of the symptoms. I saw a lot of addiction when I was {i}the fourth's{/i} shieldbearer..."
    gr "Addicts are superb at hiding their use, nephillim. They understand well what happens if they're caught."
    c "Or, you could crawl back into whatever hole you came from and let us handle it."
    gr "You're free to join me. I won't forbid it, however..."
    extend " As you know, there may be fiendish activity afoot. I recently fought a devil, and I wouldn't be surprised if 
    another is behind this."
    c "Wh-What-?!"

    "I snicker. It doesn't take much to shatter their bravado. As I predicted, they aren't prepared."
    "At least Jory remains composed. I hear he was on the frontlines during {i}the Reckoning{/i}. Nick claims he went 
    toe-to-toe with that pain devil."
    "Truth be told, I wager it's one of my kind distributing the paste. A devil appearing isn't an impossibility though."

    gr "I'm leaving now. If you're ready to die, you are free to follow."
    extend " Or, you could take credit for my work as usual. I have no use for prestige, only results."
